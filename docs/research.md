# WORKING PAPERS

* **[The Price Effects of Innovative Security Design](https://www.dropbox.com/s/29qs9ktprhh4ru4/CLVProject_WP_v7.pdf?dl=0)**, joint with [Claire Celerier](https://sites.google.com/view/clairecelerier/home) and [Boris Vallee](https://www.borisvallee.com/)

    We assess the price impact of structured retail products on equity implied volatilities and dividends, and we devise a trading strategy that arbitrage dislocations in option prices.

* **[U.S. Dollar Currency Premium in Corporate Bonds](http://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f158214.pdf)**, joint with John Caramichael and [Gita Gopinath](https://scholar.harvard.edu/gopinath/home)
